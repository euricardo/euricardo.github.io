</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<a href="Terms#">Top &uarr;</a>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="2">Understanding Your Risks</h2>
<p>Trading in Coins is speculative and high risk. You may lose some or all of any money or Coins that you hold or transact using the Platform. You should not trade Coins unless you can afford to lose your investment without hardship. <strong>Please read the Cryptopia <a href="RiskStatement">Risk Statement</a> carefully for a summary of some of the risks that you must understand before you use the Platform or Services.</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="Terms#12">clause 12</a> below for an explanation of how our liability is limited in some cases.</p>
<a href="Terms#">Top &uarr;</a>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="3">Eligibility</h2>
<p>You can use the Platform and our Services only if you meet, and continue to meet, the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>you are legally entitled to do so under the law of the country you are in, or any other relevant jurisdiction;</li>
<li>if you are an individual, you are 18 years or older;</li>
<li>if you are an entity, you are correctly formed or incorporated and in good standing;</li>
<li>you have the capacity and authority to agree to these Terms; and</li>
<li>you provide all information (including identity information) required by us to open your Account or at any time afterwards that we need to meet our obligations under law or regulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>If at any time you do not meet these criteria, you must stop using the Platform and the Services. We can close or suspend your Account at any time where you do not meet these criteria (see <a href="Terms#4">clause 4</a> below).</p>
<a href="Terms#">Top &uarr;</a>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="4">Your Account</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3 id="4_1">Opening an Account</h3>
<ol>
<li>To use the Platform and our Services, you must open an Account by completing our process through the Platform. We can decline to open an Account or provide a Service, without notice and for any reason.</li>
<li>We will require proof (satisfactory to us) of your identity when you open an account, to enable us to meet our obligations under Applicable Law (in particular any anti-money laundering or countering financing of terrorism requirements). In addition, we may ask for such other information as we consider is necessary or desirable for us to obtain before we open an Account, and by applying for an Account you agree to provide us with any such information and authorise us to use your personal information to make enquiries to verify your identity either directly or through third parties.</li>
<li>We can change our Account opening process from time to time and without notice.</li>
<li>You agree that you will provide accurate, complete and truthful information wherever we require you to provide information, including as part of the Account opening process.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="4_2">Using Your Account</h3>
<ol>
<li>Your Account comprises your Coin Balances (see <a href="Terms#5">clause 5</a> below) including, where applicable, any Fiat Pegged Tokens that you hold (see <a href="Terms#6">clause 6</a>), below), and includes a record of all of your Transactions.</li>
<li>You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.</li>
<li>
You must maintain the confidentiality and security of any information that can be used to access your Account. For this purpose, you must:
<ol>
<li>not share your password, login information, or other security related information with any other person that may allow them to access your Account;</li>
<li>not permit any other person to use or access your Account or login information;</li>
<li>notify us if there has been, or you suspect there will be, any unauthorised use of your Account; and</li>
<li>only create one Account, and not register as a user under multiple names (whether false or not).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Third parties may masquerade as a legitimate Cryptopia site, social media account, telephone support number or App, in order to steal your credentials (phishing). We do not accept any liability, either directly or indirectly, for any loss resulting from accounts that have been compromised via phishing or any other scheme.
<ol>
<li>We recommend that all users enable dynamic two factor authentication to prevent unauthorised account use.</li>
<li>Cryptopia site passwords should be unique to Cryptopia and should never be stored insecurely on any personal device.</li>
<li>You must only access your Account through the official Cryptopia website (www.cryptopia.co.nz).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You understand that anyone accessing your Account will be able to enter into transactions using your Coin Balances and, where applicable, any Fiat Pegged Tokens and we have no obligation to verify or take any steps to verify any instruction received from you or appearing to be sent by you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="4_3">We Can Suspend Your Account</h3>
<ol>
<li>
We may suspend, limit or restrict access to your Account, the Platform or any Service, at any time without notice, if:
<ol>
<li>you fail to pay any amounts owing under these Terms to us or any other person when they are due;</li>
<li>we become aware of a dispute over either the ownership of any Assets in your Account or the operation of your Account;</li>
<li>we consider it necessary or prudent to clarify the authority of any other person claiming to act on your behalf;</li>
<li>you have not provided all information needed for us to comply with any Applicable Law, or we have not been able to verify the information to our satisfaction;</li>
<li>we receive a serious complaint or multiple complaints about you from any other person;</li>
<li>we discover that some or all of the information that you have previously provided to us in order to open or operate the Account is materially inaccurate, and as a result we reasonably consider suspension is necessary or prudent to protect our, or any other person's, legitimate interests;</li>
<li>we are unable to reasonably provide the Account or any Services as a result of any resource constraint, technical failures or other difficulties in providing the Platform;</li>
<li>we reasonably consider we are required to do so by, or your continued access may result in a breach of, any Applicable Law (including any investigation, litigation or any government or regulatory proceeding relating to any Applicable Law);</li>
<li>in our sole discretion, your conduct may bring the Platform, us or any other person into disrepute; or</li>
<li>we suspect that you have breached, or your continued access might result in a breach, of these Terms.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If we suspend your Account or access to any Service, without giving you notice beforehand, we will give you notice as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards, unless we are unable to do so because of any Applicable Law.</li>
<li>The suspension will come to an end only when we are reasonably satisfied that the reason for the suspension no longer applies.</li>
<li>During the suspension, our Terms will continue to apply.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="4_4">We Can Close Your Account</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In addition to our rights under <a href="Terms#4_3">clause 4.3</a>, we can close your Account at any time and without notice if:
<ol>
<li>you have failed to pay any amounts owing under these Terms to us or any other person when they are due, and have failed upon request from us to rectify this failure within a reasonable time period;</li>
<li>we are required to do so in order to comply with any Applicable Law, in New Zealand or any other jurisdiction;</li>
<li>we reasonably believe that you have acted, or are acting, unlawfully;</li>
<li>we reasonably believe that you have been aggressive or threatening to our staff or any other Users;</li>
<li>you are not eligible for the Account, or any Service, under these Terms;</li>
<li>you have not provided all information needed for us to comply with all Applicable Laws, or we have not been able to verify the information to our reasonable satisfaction;</li>
<li>some or all of the information that you have previously provided to us in order to open or operate the Account or any Service is materially inaccurate, and as a result we reasonably consider closure or cancellation is necessary or prudent to protect the Platform or our or any other person's legitimate interests;</li>
<li>we have suspended your Account because we have been unable to reasonably provide the Account or any Services as a result of any resource constraint, technical failures or other difficulties in providing the Platform, and we are unable to recommence providing the Account or any Services within a reasonable period of time; or</li>
<li>we reasonably suspect the Account or Service is being used or obtained to facilitate fraud, money laundering or other illegal activity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If we close your Account without giving you notice beforehand, we will give you notice as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards unless we are unable to do so because of any Applicable Law.</li>
<li>
Subject to any Applicable Law, if we close your Account:
<ol>
<li>these Terms will continue to apply to any actions, including any Transactions entered into by you, before the date of cancellation;</li>
<li>you remain liable to make payment of any amounts owing to us or any other person, in relation to the use of the Platform, your Account or any Services; and</li>
<li>we may at our discretion provide you with access to the Platform solely to the extent necessary to access to your Account for a period of 90 days to allow you to transfer your Coins to a different digital wallet or to redeem any Fiat Pegged Tokens. For the avoidance of doubt, you will not be able to receive the Services or access any other component of the Platform during this period. You acknowledge that after this 90 day period, you may no longer have access to the Platform to access your Coins and we will not have any liability to you for any loss, cost, damage or expense that results from your failure to exercise your right of access during such 90 day period.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<a href="Terms#">Top &uarr;</a>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="5">Your Coin Balances</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li>Your Coin Balances form part of your Account, and allow you to send, receive and store supported Coins (see <a href="Terms#9">clause 9</a>), in accordance with instructions provided by you through the Platform.</li>
<li>You must not attempt to send, receive or store unsupported Coins in your Account. Any such actions may result in the loss of the unsupported Coins, or.</li>
<li>You must not send Coins to a wallet address for a different Coin than the currency you are sending. This is commonly known as cross-chain deposit. In recoverable instances, an appropriate recovery fee will be charged for Cryptopia executing a cross-chain recovery.</li>
<li>Your Coin Balances are operated by us, and represent entries in your name on the general ledger of ownership of Coins maintained and held by us. This means the Coins in your deposit wallets may be pooled in our internal accounts with other Users' Coins at any time.</li>
<li>Each User's entry in the general ledger of ownership of Coins is held by us, on trust, for that User.</li>
</ol>
<a href="Terms#">Top &uarr;</a>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="6">Fiat Pegged Tokens</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li>Where we are able to do so (for example, where we can access appropriate banking facilities), we may offer Fiat Pegged Tokens to enable you to upload fiat dollars to your Account in exchange for the equivalent Fiat Pegged Tokens which are tradeable on our Platform.</li>
<li>There will be an individual Fiat Pegged Token for each fiat currency we offer (for example, NZDT is a Fiat Pegged Token for New Zealand Dollars).</li>
<li>Each Fiat Pegged Token is equivalent to one fiat dollar of the respective fiat currency.</li>
<li>Fiat Pegged Tokens allow you to send, receive and store fiat currencies.</li>
<li>Fiat Pegged Tokens are not financial products in themselves and do not give you any rights or carry any obligations. They are a digital representation of fiat dollars held on trust for you in the Custodial Account. Under these Terms, you hold the beneficial interest in those fiat dollars and can instruct us as trustee to deliver them to you at any time, subject to these Terms (including the risks set out in the Cryptopia <a href="RiskStatement">Risk Statement</a>). We do not promise to pay you any amount in relation to Fiat Pegged Tokens out of our own funds.</li>
<li>In order to obtain Fiat Pegged Tokens from the equivalent fiat currency you must provide us with details of a Nominated Account held with a bank registered to the country of the fiat currency you wish to use. When we are able to offer Fiat Pegged Tokens supported by Cryptopia, you can transfer fiat dollars from your Nominated Account to our Custodial Account. We will hold an amount equal to your deposit in the Custodial Account on trust for you. For each fiat dollar we hold in the Custodial Account on your behalf we will issue and credit one equivalent Fiat Pegged Token to your Coin Wallet.</li>
<li>If you transfer or trade a Fiat Pegged Token with another person through our Platform, you instruct us to hold one fiat dollar in the Custodial Account on a new trust for the transferee.</li>
<li>You may request a withdrawal of Fiat Pegged Tokens supported by Cryptopia through the Platform and, subject to these Terms, we will pay the equivalent amount in the respective fiat currency from the Custodial Account to your Nominated Account held with a registered bank, subject to any minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts in place, and less any withdrawal fee and deductions required by Applicable Law.</li>
<li>We will try to action any issue of new Fiat Pegged Tokens or your withdrawal request as soon as we are reasonably able to do so. However, there may be a delay as a result of events outside of our control, including as a result of a sudden increase in Transaction volumes, regulatory changes, blockchain issues, or as a result of a request coming through outside of normal banking hours.</li>
<li>You will not receive any interest earned on fiat dollars stored in the Custodial Account. Any interest earned on the Custodial Account will be paid to Cryptopia as a fee.</li>
<li>We will not use the fiat dollars held on trust in the Custodial Account for any purpose other than to meet our obligations to you in respect of your Fiat Pegged Tokens, nor can we charge or otherwise encumber them.</li>
<li>Fiat Pegged Tokens are available at our discretion. For regulatory, commercial or other reasons we may give notice to Users that we have decided to suspend or to cease offering one or more of our Fiat Pegged Tokens. If we cease offering a Fiat Pegged Token we will, where possible, give affected Users notice of a timeframe within which they must withdraw, or exchange for Coins, the Fiat Pegged Tokens in their Wallets. Any remaining Fiat Pegged Tokens will, after this time, be withdrawn and the matching fiat dollar amount paid to the relevant User's Nominated Account. If this is unavailable or difficult Cryptopia may instead chose to remove the tokens from your account and replace them with the equivalent value of BTC or another major currency at an appropriate market rate of exchange.</li>

<li>
<h2 id="7">Trading on the Platform</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3 id="7_1">Your Obligations and Acknowledgements in Relation to Transactions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In respect of Transactions you submit into the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that:
<ol>
<li>we do not own or control any of the underlying blockchains, software protocols or networks in respect of Coins, and make no warranties or representations regarding their security, effectiveness or proper functioning;</li>
<li>we may impose such restrictions as we reasonably think fit for the efficient processing of Transactions and in order to reduce the risk of theft and fraud. These restrictions may include maximum or minimum individual Transaction limits and maximum daily limits, in relation to a Coin, type or group of Coins, User or group of Users or type or types of Transactions;</li>
<li>you will only use the Platform and the Services to undertake Transactions on your own behalf, and not on behalf of anyone else;</li>
<li>while we will use reasonable endeavours to process Transactions as quickly as possible, Cryptopia gives no guarantee or warranty regarding the timing of completion of any Transaction. Transaction completion may be delayed for a significant period of time, or indefinitely, for a number of reasons including those set out in the <em>Cryptopia <a href="RiskStatement">Risk Statement</a></em>;</li>
<li>we will act on the instructions sent from your Account and we have no obligation to verify any instruction received from, or appearing to be sent from, your Account.</li>

<h3 id="7_2">Reversals, Cancellations</h3>
<ol>
<li>You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any Transaction once it is submitted.</li>
<li>
We have the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any submitted Transaction for any reason, including:
<ol>
<li>where in our opinion completing the Transaction could result in a breach or potential breach of any Applicable Law;</li>
<li>if we reasonably consider the Transaction is erroneous; or</li>
<li>where we reasonably consider the Transaction has the potential to bring into disrepute us, the Platform or any User.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="7_3">Agent</h3>
<p>You appoint Cryptopia, and Cryptopia accepts the appointment, as your agent for any Transaction in Coins that you have entered into through your Account on the Platform, in accordance with these Terms.</p>

<li>
<h2 id="8">Platform Change and Business Disruptions</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li>We will use reasonable care in operating our Platform, so as to limit disruptions to the Platform, User Accounts and our Services. However, you accept that our Platform will not necessarily be available uninterrupted or error-free, and it may also be inaccessible from time to time while undergoing maintenance or upgrade work. If we are not able to provide advance notice of any interruption, we will give notice as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards.</li>
<li>We may, in our discretion, make changes to the Platform with or without notice, and we make no representation that any Services will continue to be provided in the same manner as they are currently provided.</li>
</ol>
<a href="Terms#">Top &uarr;</a>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="9">Supported Coins</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3 id="9_1">Supported Coins</h3>
<ol>
<li>We will from time to time publish a list of Coins supported on our Platform.</li>
<li>
It is your responsibility to determine whether you should acquire, exchange or sell any Coin, and you should seek professional advice before doing so. By supporting a Coin on our Platform, we make no representations, and give no warranties:
<ol>
<li>whether you should purchase, sell, or hold any Coin, or in relation to the performance, value of or benefits associated with that Coin;</li>
<li>as to any rights or obligations you may have as a holder of that Coin;</li>
<li>as to whether the terms of the Coin have been accurately represented by the issuer or any promoter of that Coin;</li>
<li>the success of any business or project related to any Coin; or</li>
<li>that the issuer has complied with any or all Applicable Laws in relation to that Coin, or that it has received any required regulatory approvals, licences, or registrations to enable it to issue or offer the Coin.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Cryptopia, its officers, employees, agents and contractors do not provide any advice in relation to Transactions. You must not rely on anything we say as intended to:
<ol>
<li>pass judgement on the merits of any particular Coin;</li>

<li>make any recommendation regarding the advisability of investing in any Coin for any particular individual.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Coins supported on the Platform may change from time to time without notice to any User, for any reason, including as a result of any Applicable Laws, any change to the underlying rules of a Coin, or any technological issue outside of our reasonable control.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to confirm that any Coin is a supported Coin. You will be responsible for any loss incurred as a result of sending, depositing or returning any Coins that are not supported by us.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3 id="9_2">Coins in Maintenance</h3>
<ol>
<li>From time to time, as part of the risks of trading in Coins, a Coin supported on the Platform may be placed in maintenance. During maintenance, you cannot deposit or withdraw the affected Coin.</li>
<li>
Circumstances in which we may put a Coin into maintenance include:
<ol>
<li>developer requests;</li>
<li>the Coin is out of sync with its blockchain;</li>
<li>routine maintenance;</li>
<li>mandatory updates; and</li>
<li>other blockchain related issues.</li>

<h3 id="9_3">Delisting Coins</h3>
<ol>
<li>From time to time, we may delist Coins from the Platform (meaning they can no longer be traded) for technical, legal or any other reason at our discretion.</li>
<li>
Generally, the procedure in which we will delist a specific Coin is as follows:
<ol>
<li>the market for the Coin is closed and from that point you will not be able to buy or sell the Coin; and</li>
<li>we will give at least a 30 day notice on the removal of the Coin. At that time, the status of the Coin becomes "delisting".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>During the 30 day notice period, you must ensure that you withdraw the specific Coin from the Platform, to an external wallet, and cancel any outstanding Transactions. If you do not withdraw your balance of the Coin from the Platform you may lose the balance of the Coin at the time it is removed.</li>
<li>After the notice period and once the Coin is delisted, the Coin will no longer be able to be deposited, withdrawn, bought or sold on the platform. If possible, any un-processed Transactions in respect of the Coin will not be processed and any related Coin or amount will be returned to the User.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that we may immediately delist a Coin, without following the process set out above, where the removal is urgently required for compliance with any Applicable Law or where we consider the continued support of the Coin may result in a serious risk of harm or legal liability to us, the Platform, the Services or any User.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that some Coins may be delisted without the option to withdraw the Coin from the Platform during the 30 day notice period. This will occur when the Coin is unable to be withdrawn due to technical, legal or any other reason at our discretion.</li>
<li>Cryptopia does not accept any liability, either directly or indirectly, with any loss caused by delisting a Coin.</li>
